Emma works at a Veterinary Clinic, and has been tasked with sorting out some of the paperwork. The Vets have managed to digitize their records, but didn't have the time to properly organise all the animals that they look after. This is where Emma comes in.

The clinic wants to know a few things about the animals in their care;

A list of:
  - all the cats and dogs
  - the more exotic animals
  - all the male and female animals
  - all the animals younger than 5, and all the animals older than 15, as they may require special attention

Additionally,
  - they'd like to know how to call the owners up at reception when the Vet is ready. This should be the animals name, along with the owners surname.
  - a total of how much fee they will collect from dog and cat owners.
  - A list of all the owners

Assuming that all the records are in a records.json, write some helper functions that will assist Emma with her work.
